## Abstract

Cancer research now produces knowledge graphs, multi-omic assays and dynamical simulators in parallel [10,53,61]. The failure mode is collapsing those layers. This study asks whether a provenance-controlled pipeline can keep the layers apart while still allowing testable predictions. Scientific success is a staged chain -- traceability, mathematical validity, identifiability, out-of-sample prediction, experimental falsification -- not disease eradication [43-52].

CONFLUENCE v2 is a frozen 15-dimensional computational cancer-state model with an optional connectome-style controller [11,58,60]. OnCo is a public, cited oncology knowledge graph [10,61]. They are complementary only if knowledge is not written into parameters [57,58]. Pull request #9 shipped a read-only OnCo adapter and nine refusal tests. It is architectural evidence for the gates, not therapeutic efficacy [11,56].

GLOBOCAN 2024 estimates, published 2026, place the contemporary burden at about 20.6 million diagnoses and 9.8 million deaths [1,2,64]. That statistic motivates computational oncology; it is not a CONFLUENCE parameter [1,59]. This document records the gates, the P0 adapter, the LDHA / `p_lactate` refusal, and the honesty rule that OnCo confidence is not P(H) [10,11,36,63].

The key objectives of this research study are to:

i. Forbid skip-level promotion from OnCo knowledge to ordinary-differential-equation (ODE) parameters  
ii. Classify legacy artefacts, including `validation/gene_to_parameter_map.json`, as assumed / unidentified rather than as identified Θ  
iii. Ship and audit a read-only P0 adapter without editing `CancerODE`  
iv. Keep the OnCo Ideas shelf separate from any CONFLUENCE hypothesis library  
v. Define success as gated, falsifiable computational work, not a universal cure

The methodology in this study is computational. Materials are public software artefacts, cited knowledge-graph records, and numbered Vancouver references. No patient data were used. No wet-lab assay was performed.

Findings from this study revealed that the honesty ladder holds as an object model; that `refuse_knowledge_as_parameter(OncoRef("ldha"), "p_lactate")` returns provenance `forbidden`; that the legacy gene-to-parameter map remains assumed / unidentified; and that pull request #9 does not edit `CancerODE`. No new parameter was identified. No patient outcome is claimed.

**This thesis is research only. It is not a medical device, not clinical decision support, and not a wet-lab antidiabetic study.**

# CHAPTER ONE

## 1.0 INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Background to the study

Oncology knowledge graphs and dynamical models

Oncology knowledge graphs name genes, diseases, ideas and citations [10,53,61]. Dynamical simulators ask how a state moves under control [8,39,43,44]. Mixing the two without provenance treats a web page as an identified parameter [45-52,57]. The problem stated on the public thesis page, and restated here, is: how can heterogeneous oncology knowledge and molecular observations be incorporated into a cancer dynamical model without collapsing evidence, mechanism, parameterisation and prediction into unsupported assumptions [57,59]?

GLOBOCAN 2024 estimates, published 8 July 2026, report about 20.6 million diagnoses and 9.8 million deaths across 34 cancer types in 186 countries [1,2,64]. Female breast cancer accounted for about 2.43 million new cases in that estimate series [1,2]. Those figures continue a modelled GLOBOCAN series previously reported for 2022 and 2020 [54,55]. WHO states that many cancers can be cured if detected early and treated effectively, while access remains uneven [3]. That sentence is a policy statement about staged, treatable disease -- not a claim that CONFLUENCE or OnCo cures patients [3,10,11,56]. The WHO global status report on cancer 2026 is cited as health-system context only [4]. Nigeria GLOBOCAN *2022* estimates (127,763 new cases; 79,542 deaths; breast 32,278) are setting context only; they are not 2026 incidence [5].

Cancer as an adaptive, microenvironment-coupled process

Cancer is organised as a set of acquired capabilities -- the hallmarks -- rather than as a single targetable defect [13-15]. Tumours evolve clonally and adapt under therapy [7,16,17]. Intra-tumour heterogeneity, branched evolution and therapy resistance are documented empirical features of that process [18-21]. Multi-omics increase resolution without automatically producing a causal model [20,43,49]. The tumour microenvironment recruits stromal and immune cells that regulate progression, exclusion and metastasis [22-27]. Mathematical oncology supplies in-silico laboratories that couple those layers as dynamical systems [8,39]. Adaptive therapy treats treatment as a process under selection rather than as a fixed maximum-tolerated pulse [9,40,41]. The gap this thesis addresses is connecting knowledge to dynamical hypotheses without dropping provenance [10,11,57].

TNBC as a computational test case, not a treated cohort

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is used as a test case because NCI describes it as roughly 15% of breast cancers, typically faster-growing and more recurrent, and heterogeneous [6]. Independent reviews describe the same clinical heterogeneity and recurrence pattern [28-31]. That description is not a CONFLUENCE parameter [6,56,63]. No patient with TNBC was enrolled, treated, or simulated as a named person in this study.

### 1.2 STATEMENT OF RESEARCH PROBLEM

How can heterogeneous oncology knowledge-graph records and molecular observations be incorporated into a frozen cancer dynamical model without collapsing knowledge, evidence, mechanism, parameterisation, and prediction into unsupported assumptions [10,45-53,57,61]?

That is the research problem. It is a computational and medical-methods problem. It is not a claim to treat, dose, or cure patients [3,56].

Cancer research now produces knowledge graphs, multi-omic assays, and dynamical simulators in parallel [10,20,43,44,53,61]. OnCo names genes, diseases, ideas, and citations [10,61]. CONFLUENCE v2 asks how a frozen 15-dimensional state moves under an in-silico controller [11,58,60]. Mixing the two without provenance treats a web page, an OnCo confidence score, or a legacy numeric map as an identified parameter Θ [45-52,57,63]. The conversion ladder -- Knowledge -> Evidence -> Hypothesis -> Mechanism -> Parameter -> Prediction -> Experiment -> new Evidence -- has a failure point at every arrow [57]. A literature record may motivate a hypothesis; it must not become Θ [45,47,51,57].

The problem is therefore to keep those layers as typed objects, to refuse skip-level promotion (including LDHA as `p_lactate`), and to define scientific success as a staged, falsifiable chain rather than as disease eradication [11,12,36,43-52,56,58].

### 1.3 JUSTIFICATION OF STUDY

Existing integration habits fail in documented ways that this study is built to catch.

**Overclaiming.** GLOBOCAN 2024 estimates (about 20.6 million diagnoses and 9.8 million deaths) and WHO language that many cancers can be cured if found early and treated well are health-system context [1-4,54,55,64]. They are not CONFLUENCE parameters and not a product claim [56,59]. Adaptive-therapy and mathematical-oncology papers supply in-silico laboratories and control ideas; they are not CONFLUENCE efficacy [8,9,39-41]. Biomedical knowledge graphs integrate assertions; they remain literature objects until an identification step is performed [53].

**Parameter smuggling.** The P0 findings record the failure mode: treat OnCo's LDHA lactate-metabolism listing as the v2 symbol `p_lactate`, or treat `validation/gene_to_parameter_map.json` (`LDHA -> pyruvate_to_lactate (+0.10 / +0.30)`) as identified Θ [10,11,36,58,63]. Alias trap: legacy `pyruvate_to_lactate` is not v2 `p_lactate` (default 0.22) [58,63]. Warburg and lactate-immune papers explain why the gene is scientifically interesting; they do not identify the coefficient [32-38,42]. OnCo `confidence.probability` is not P(H). Idea maturity is not evidence level [10,57,59].

**Missing gates.** Structural identifiability asks whether a unique parameter vector is consistent with noise-free input-output data [45,46,48,50]. Practical identifiability asks whether finite, noisy data actually constrain those parameters [47,52]. Nonlinear biological systems are often only partially observable; unidentified symbols must remain labelled as such [51]. Without Gate 4, a silent write from a knowledge record into `CancerODE` produces a confident but unidentifiable model [43-52,57]. Hallmarks, clonal evolution, intra-tumour heterogeneity, and the tumour microenvironment further explain why a named gene or a TNBC subtype label is not a sufficient statistic for Θ [6,7,13-21,22-31].

**What this study therefore does.** Pull request #9 shipped a read-only OnCo adapter and nine refusal tests without editing `CancerODE` [11,58]. This manuscript records those gates as architectural evidence, not as therapeutic efficacy [11,56].

### 1.4 AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY

The aim of this research is to specify and audit an evidence-gated computational framework that can bind a public oncology knowledge graph (OnCo) to a frozen cancer dynamical model (CONFLUENCE v2) without treating a cited page, a confidence score, or a legacy numeric map as an identified parameter.

The objectives of this research study are to:

i. Forbid skip-level promotion from OnCo knowledge to ODE parameters [10,11,57,58]  
ii. Classify legacy artefacts, including `validation/gene_to_parameter_map.json`, as assumed / unidentified rather than as identified Θ [47,51,52,63]  
iii. Ship a read-only P0 adapter without editing `CancerODE` [11,58]  
iv. Keep the OnCo Ideas shelf separate from any CONFLUENCE hypothesis library [10,61]  
v. Define success as gated, falsifiable computational work -- control and disease-specific clearance -- not a universal cure [3,12,56]

### 1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY

**Scientific significance for researchers.** The work treats cancer as a dynamic, adaptive, microenvironment-coupled process rather than as a bag of independent named targets [7,13-17,22-27]. It gives laboratories a typed conversion ladder and a success criterion -- traceability, mathematical validity, identifiability, out-of-sample prediction, experimental falsification -- that can fail honestly [12,43-52,57]. Failed or refused claims (LDHA as `p_lactate`) stay visible [11,58,63].

**Methodological significance.** Evidence gates and the identifiability literature become refusal rules, not a new structural-identifiability proof for `confluence_v2_15d` [45-52]. Layer objects (`OncoRef`, Evidence, Mechanism, Parameter, Prediction) may point at the next layer; they may not collapse into it [57]. Public claims require a ledger id or a numbered Vancouver reference; DOIs are not invented [59].

**What this significance is not.** It is not clinical decision support, not a medical device, not a dosing table, and not a cure [3,56]. GLOBOCAN burden figures motivate computational oncology; they do not licence a CONFLUENCE product [1,2,56,64]. Translation waits for Gates 6-8, which this repository does not claim to have passed [3,12,56]. The significance of the study is methodological honesty for researchers, not a path to a clinic. It is also not a wet-lab claim about plant extracts or silver nanoparticles.

### 1.6 SCOPE OF THE STUDY

This study is limited to computational architecture and software-gate audit on Project Confluence artefacts. The scope covers: the P0 OnCo adapter; the five-layer object model; the conversion ladder; refusal of LDHA as `p_lactate`; and classification of the legacy gene-to-parameter map as unidentified.

The scope does not include: patient recruitment; wet-lab assay; ODE refit; automatic fitting; 3-state ROS import; 6-state expansion; clinical trial; RECIST adjudication; or a dosing table [12,56]. GLOBOCAN and WHO figures are setting context only [1-5,64]. Nigeria 2022 estimates are not 2026 incidence [5]. This document has no DOI.

# CHAPTER TWO

## 2.0 LITERATURE REVIEW

### 2.1 Oncology knowledge graphs and dynamical simulators

OnCo answers what is named, linked, dated and cited [10,61]. Biomedical knowledge graphs more generally integrate heterogeneous assertions; they remain literature objects until an identification step is performed [53]. CONFLUENCE v2 answers how a frozen 15-D state moves under an in-silico controller [11,58,60]. The working hypothesis of this thesis is that those artefacts are complementary provided they are not collapsed into each other [57].

OnCo Ideas carry hypothesis, rationale, test and maturity fields [10,61]. Bulk ingest into CONFLUENCE is forbidden [57,58]. Idea maturity is not evidence level. OnCo `confidence.probability` is not P(H) [57,59]. OnCo integration does not justify changing the dynamics [11,58].

### 2.2 Hallmarks, heterogeneity and the tumour microenvironment

Hanahan and Weinberg organised neoplastic growth as a small set of acquired capabilities, later expanded and re-dimensioned [13-15]. That organising frame is why a knowledge graph of named targets is not a closed dynamical explanation: the same hallmark can be implemented by different molecular routes [14,15,20]. Clonal evolution and ecological competition supply the time axis [16,17]. Intra-tumour heterogeneity is both a looking-glass for those processes and a documented source of therapeutic failure [7,18-21].

The tumour microenvironment is not a passive backdrop. Recruited stromal and immune populations regulate progression and metastasis [22-24]. T-cell exclusion and oncogenic-pathway-driven immune evasion are review-level mechanisms for why a metabolic or antigenic fact does not become a control law [25,26]. Exhaustion is a distinct T-cell state, not a synonym for "the immune variable is low" [27]. None of those reviews is treated here as an identified CONFLUENCE coupling.

### 2.3 Warburg metabolism and lactate as research context

Aerobic glycolysis is a classical observation in cancer cells [32]. Later work reframed the Warburg effect as a proliferation-linked metabolic programme rather than a simple mitochondrial defect [33-35]. Lactate is not only a waste product: tumour-derived lactic acid can polarise macrophages and blunt T- and NK-cell surveillance [36-38]. A microenvironmental model of carcinogenesis treats acidification and selection as coupled processes [42].

OnCo lists LDHA among lactate-metabolism targets [10]. The CONFLUENCE v2 symbol `p_lactate` is a frozen-model parameter. The P0 adapter refuses to write the OnCo record into that symbol [11,36,58,63]. The literature explains why the gene is scientifically interesting. It does not identify Θ.

### 2.4 Mathematical oncology and adaptive control

Ordinary differential equations, stochastic models, agent-based approaches and control-theoretic methods can represent tumour growth, treatment response and resistance as in-silico laboratories [8,39]. Adaptive therapy, introduced as an evolutionary alternative to continuous maximum-tolerated dosing, treats sensitive clones as competitive suppressors of resistant clones [9,40]. A later clinical-research programme in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer is cited only as context that the control idea has a literature, not as a CONFLUENCE protocol or a patient result [41]. CONFLUENCE controllers that implement a Gatenby-style treat-and-halt heuristic remain in-silico research arms [9,12,56].

### 2.5 Identifiability of dynamical biological models

Systems biology treats a model as a formal object whose parameters may or may not be recoverable from observations [43,44]. Structural identifiability asks whether a unique parameter vector is consistent with noise-free input-output data [45,46,48,50]. Practical identifiability asks whether finite, noisy data actually constrain those parameters [47,52]. Nonlinear biological systems are often only partially observable; unidentified symbols must remain labelled as such [51]. Reverse engineering and identification remain open strategies with stated limits [49]. This literature is used in Chapter Three as Gate 4, not as a new identifiability computation for `confluence_v2_15d`.

### 2.6 Frozen CONFLUENCE lineages and OnCo Ideas

Frozen lineages in this repository are:

**Table 2-1. Frozen CONFLUENCE lineages**

| ID | Role | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `tnbc_mod_3s` | TNBC-Metabolic-Strain-MOD notebooks | frozen; ROS audit pending [62] |
| `confluence_report_6s` | report architecture X = [T, I, S, L, R, H] | paper only [60] |
| `confluence_v2_15d` | live 15-D CancerODE | adapter sits around it [11,58] |
| `confluence_v1_calibrator` | `gene_to_parameter_map.json` | executable, not identified [63] |

**Table 2-2. Layer objects (ontology spec v0.3)**

The ingestion spec keeps five objects [57]. A record may point at the next layer. It may not collapse into it.

| Layer | Object | Allowed question | Forbidden leap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Knowledge | `OncoRef` | What does OnCo name and link? | therefore k = … |
| Evidence | `EvidenceObject` | What was measured, where, in what system? | therefore this term belongs in F |
| Causal mechanism | `MechanismObject` | do(U) changes which state, in which context? | therefore identifiable from CCLE |
| Parameter | `ParameterObject` | Which symbol in which frozen model? | silent write into rhs_cancer |
| Prediction | `PredictionObject` | Frozen-model output under U, with uncertainty | clinical advice |

**Figure 2-1. Conversion ladder**

```
OnCo knowledge
  --cite--> Evidence          (source URI + rung required)
    --interpret--> Hypothesis (falsifier required)
      --propose--> Mechanism  (context + sign + do-operator)
        --identify--> Parameter  (model_id + symbol + identifiability ≠ unidentified)
          --simulate--> Prediction
            --test--> Experiment
              --write--> Evidence
```

Every arrow is a failure point. A page may motivate a hypothesis; it must not become Θ [45,47,51,57]. No arrow may skip a box. Wired RHS terms remain Parameters with provenance `assumed` until identified [52,63].

legacy gene->parameter map != identified parameter mapping. Alias trap: legacy `pyruvate_to_lactate` is not v2 `p_lactate` (default 0.22) [58,63].

# CHAPTER THREE

## 3.0 MATERIALS AND METHODS

### 3.1 Study design and honesty statement

This is a computational methods and architecture study. There is no human-subjects protocol, no animal protocol, no chart review, and no wet-lab bench work. Inputs are public software artefacts, cited OnCo records, and numbered Vancouver references. Outputs are gate audits, adapter refusal cases, and this manuscript. The analysis unit is the **software object**, not the patient.

Materials:

- Project Confluence software and documentation (`confluence/onco/`, `docs/ONCO_ADAPTER.md`, ontology spec v0.3) [11,57,58,60]
- OnCo public knowledge graph (data CC BY-NC 4.0) [10,61]
- Legacy map `validation/gene_to_parameter_map.json` [63]
- Validation protocol `validation/validation_protocol.md` [12]
- Honesty gates as stated in DISCLAIMER.md [56]

Results in Chapter Four are therefore in-silico / architectural. They must not be read as patient outcomes or as wet-lab antidiabetic findings.

### 3.2 Honesty gates

The public protocol is sequential and falsifiable [12,56,59]. It is not a treatment path.

**Table 3-1. Honesty gates**

| Gate | Requirement |
|---|---|
| 0 | Research-only scope. Not a medical device. Not clinical decision support. [56] |
| 1 | Provenance: source, URI, date, population. [59] |
| 2 | Evidence class named. [57] |
| 3 | Mechanism: intervention, state, sign, context, falsifier. [57] |
| 4 | Parameter: model id, symbol, units, estimator, uncertainty, identifiability. Unidentified != established. [45-52] |
| 5 | Prediction labelled as computational. [56] |
| 6 | Held-out / external / baseline validation. [12] |
| 7 | An experiment that could show the prediction is wrong. [12] |
| 8 | Translation only after biological and clinical validation this repository does not claim. [3,56] |

Scientific success is: traceability -> mathematical validity -> identifiability -> out-of-sample prediction -> experimental falsification [43,44,51,52].

### 3.3 Identifiability as a methods claim, not a result

CONFLUENCE Gate 4 is the identifiability literature applied as a refusal rule: OnCo confidence and the legacy numeric map are not estimators [10,47,63]. This manuscript does not report a new identifiability computation.

### 3.4 Adapter P0

`confluence/onco/` is a read-only client: cache envelope, bindings, schemas [11,58]. Commands documented in `docs/ONCO_ADAPTER.md` include fixture `meta`, `bind --id ldha`, and `wired` [58]. `bind()` returns slot annotations. It never writes `p_lactate` or `pyruvate_to_lactate` [11,63]. `refuse_knowledge_as_parameter` returns provenance `forbidden` [11,57]. Tests live in `tests/test_onco_adapter.py` [11,60].

OnCo data is CC BY-NC 4.0 [10,61]. Adapter code in this repository is MIT [60]. Cached payloads are not vendored; live cache stays under `data/onco/cache/` (gitignored) [58]. Attribution on every export: Data from OnCo (onco.cc), CC BY-NC 4.0; commercial use needs a licence [10,59].

P0 ships: read-only client + cache envelope + bindings + nine gates [11,58]. P0 does not ship: RHS edits, controller edits, 3-state ROS import, 6-state expansion, automatic fitting, reverse writes to OnCo [11,58,62].

### 3.5 Refusal rules

1. Do not vendor the OnCo corpus [10,61].  
2. OnCo is not a parameter source. `refuse_knowledge_as_parameter(OncoRef("ldha"), "p_lactate")` returns provenance `forbidden` [11,36,58].  
3. OnCo is not a controller prior [9,40,58].  
4. Wired RHS terms remain Parameters with provenance `assumed` until identified [47,52,63].  
5. No reverse writes to OnCo [10,61].  
6. No ODE right-hand-side edits in the P0 / thesis-#1 scope [11,58].  
7. Public claims need a ledger id or a numbered reference (`docs/CITATION_POLICY.md`) [59].  
8. Do not fabricate DOIs [59].

This manuscript uses the Vancouver entries generated from `docs/manuscript/thesis_01_bibliography.json`. Every `doi:` field was checked against Crossref or PubMed on 20 September 2026. Agency and GitHub items are URL citations without a DOI [2-7,10-12,56-64].

### 3.6 What was not done

No patient data. No ODE refit. No automatic fitting. No 3-state ROS import. No 6-state expansion. No clinical trial, RECIST adjudication, or dosing table [12,56]. No phytochemical assay, nanoparticle synthesis, or alpha-amylase inhibition study was performed. Those belong to a separate wet-lab B.Sc. project and are not mixed into this computational thesis.

# CHAPTER FOUR

## 4.0 RESULTS

These are specification and software-architecture findings. They are not experimental oncology results and not patient outcomes [56]. Tables and figures below are computational audits, gate outcomes, and refusal cases.

### 4.1 Honesty ladder as an object model

Knowledge, Evidence, Causal mechanism, Parameter and Prediction are separate types [57]. A record may point at the next layer. It may not collapse into it.

### 4.2 LDHA is not `p_lactate` (refuse-as-parameter)

`refuse_knowledge_as_parameter(OncoRef("ldha"), "p_lactate")` is `forbidden` [11,58]. The auditor demo claim -- that LDHA expression can be entered as `p_lactate` because OnCo lists LDHA as a lactate-metabolism target -- is the claim the gate is built to reject [10,32,36,63].

### 4.3 Legacy map is assumed / unidentified

`validation/gene_to_parameter_map.json` maps LDHA -> `pyruvate_to_lactate` (+0.10 / +0.30) [63]. That row is a legacy numeric hint, not an identified v2 parameter [47,51,52].

### 4.4 No ODE writes

PR #9 and the P0 adapter do not edit `CancerODE.rhs_cancer` [11,58].

### 4.5 OnCo is a cited graph, not Θ

OnCo is a cited graph, not Θ [10,61]. Counts move with `buildDate`.

### 4.6 Three-arm programme remains a protocol

`validation/validation_protocol.md` states H0 versus H1. Thresholds such as r > 0.5 are criteria, not findings [12].

### 4.7 Public ledger

Public ledger keeps year and population. Claims `EVID-001`-`EVID-010` on the thesis page cite [1-12] without promoting burden statistics into model parameters [1,5,59,64].

No wet-lab measurement is reported here. No new parameter was identified [45,52,56].

# CHAPTER FIVE

## 5.0 DISCUSSION, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

### 5.1 Discussion

Keeping OnCo and CONFLUENCE apart is the result [10,11,57]. Integration is valuable only as a gated pipeline: cite -> interpret -> propose -> identify -> simulate -> test [49,57]. Collapsing any two boxes produces a confident but unidentifiable model [45,47,51].

The hallmarks, clonal-evolution and microenvironment literatures explain why a named gene, a lactate observation, or a TNBC subtype label is not a sufficient statistic for Θ [13-15,16-21,22-27,28-31]. Warburg and lactate-immune papers explain why LDHA appears in OnCo and why lactate is biologically non-trivial; they still do not license a silent write into `p_lactate` [32-38,42]. Mathematical oncology and adaptive-therapy papers explain why a controller layer can exist around a frozen model; they are not CONFLUENCE efficacy [8,9,39-41].

WHO language that many cancers can be cured if found early and treated well is retained as a health-system statement [3,4]. It is not transferred to CONFLUENCE as a product claim [56]. Prior GLOBOCAN editions (2020, 2022) are cited so that the 2024/2026 series is not treated as a one-off number [1,54,55,64].

Disease profiles and the thinking lab are scaffolds for questions. They are not protocols and are not the Scholar landing page [56,59]. The Scholar article URL is `/thesis` with the same-directory PDF `/thesis.pdf`.

Do not expand the state vector merely because OnCo lists more cell types [10,23,61]. Cache has no TTL yet [58]. Those are engineering limits, not clinical limits [56].

Limitations of this study, stated so they cannot be skipped:

- No new wet-lab measurement [56].  
- PR #9 does not identify `p_lactate` or any other Θ [11,52].  
- The 3-state ROS notebook remains unaudited [62].  
- The three-arm protocol can fail; that would still be a result [12].  
- OnCo counts move with `buildDate` [10].  
- The optional Grok auditor may miss sources; "insufficient" is preferred to invented citations [59].  
- Nigeria 2022 estimates are setting context only [5].  
- This document has no DOI.  
- Identifiability citations define Gate 4; they are not a new structural-identifiability proof for `confluence_v2_15d` [45-52].

### 5.2 Conclusion

The aim of this research was to bind OnCo knowledge to a frozen CONFLUENCE dynamical model without collapsing knowledge into parameters. The study concludes that:

i. The five-layer object model and conversion ladder can be stated as typed, refuseable contracts [57].  
ii. The P0 adapter refuses LDHA as `p_lactate` and does not edit `CancerODE` [11,58].  
iii. The legacy gene-to-parameter map remains assumed / unidentified [63].  
iv. Scientific success for this thesis is architectural honesty, not disease eradication [3,12,43-52,56].

This work is computational research. It is not a medical device, not CDS, not a dose, and not a cure. It is not the 2022 wet-lab Carica papaya AgNP antidiabetic project.

### 5.3 Recommendation

The following recommendations follow from the gates, not from a clinic:

i. Iterate the adapter without RHS edits [11,58].  
ii. Admit-list a hypothesis library separate from OnCo Ideas [10,61].  
iii. Identify `p_lactate` only after gates 1-4 stay green and an estimator with uncertainty exists [47,52,58].  
iv. Complete external / held-out validation (Gate 6) before any experimental falsifier (Gate 7) [12].  
v. Optional later: deposit this PDF on Zenodo or a preprint server and only then add `citation_doi` to the HTML landing page.  
vi. Translation (Gate 8) should remain out of scope until biological and clinical validation that this repository does not claim [3,56].
